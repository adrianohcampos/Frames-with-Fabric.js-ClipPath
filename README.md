## üíª Technologies Used

- [Fabric.js v5.3.1](http://fabricjs.com/) - Powerful canvas manipulation library
- HTML5 Canvas
- JavaScript ES6+
- CSS3 with responsive design

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Frame Creation**
   - Shapes are created using Fabric.js geometric objects
   - Each shape has custom properties for frame identification
   - Shapes are initially rendered with semi-transparency for preview

2. **ClipPath System**
   - Uses Fabric.js ClipPath feature to mask images
   - Each frame type has a corresponding ClipPath generator
   - ClipPaths are dynamically scaled to match frame dimensions

3. **Image Processing**
   - Images are loaded using Fabric.js image loader
   - Automatic scaling to fit frame dimensions
   - Maintains aspect ratio while filling frame
   - Supports both local uploads and URL sources

4. **Advanced Edit Mode Implementation**
   - Custom double-click handler for mode switching
   - Temporary removal of ClipPath during editing
   - Semi-transparent backdrop for full image visibility
   - Real-time position and crop updates
   - Checkerboard pattern background for better visibility
   - Object locking system during editing
   - State management with frameEditState object
   - Z-index preservation for proper object stacking
   - Advanced mouse event handling for precise control

### Technical Features

- **Frame Management**
  ```javascript
  // Frame creation with metadata
  frame = new fabric.Circle({
    radius: 100,
    metadata: { frameType: 'circle' }
  });
  ```

- **ClipPath System**
  ```javascript
  // Dynamic ClipPath generation
  image.clipPath = createClipPath(
    frameType,
    width,
    height
  );
  ```

- **Image Handling**
  ```javascript
  // Image scaling and positioning
  const scale = Math.max(
    targetWidth / img.width,
    targetHeight / img.height
  );
  ```

- **Advanced Edit Mode**
  ```javascript
  // Edit mode activation with state management
  group.on('mousedblclick', enterEditMode);
  img.on('mousedblclick', exitEditMode);
  
  // State management
  const frameEditState = {
      isEditMode: false,
      zIndex: null,
      shapeRef: null
  };
  ```

- **Advanced Cropping System**
  ```javascript
  // Checkerboard pattern for better visibility
  const checkerboardPattern = new fabric.Pattern({
      source: tempCanvas,
      repeat: 'repeat'
  });
  
  // Real-time crop adjustment
  const handleScaling = function (e) {
      const image = e.transform.target;
      if (image.isCropping) {
          // Advanced crop calculations
          const diffX = image.left - backdrop.left;
          const diffY = image.top - backdrop.top;
          image.cropX = diffX;
          image.cropY = diffY;
      }
  };
  ```

- **Object Locking System**
  ```javascript
  // Lock all objects except active one
  function lockAllExcept(activeObject) {
      canvas.getObjects().forEach(obj => {
          if (obj !== activeObject) {
              obj.set({ selectable: false, evented: false });
          }
      });
  }
  ```
